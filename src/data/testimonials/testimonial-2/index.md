Balu Praveen is one of the most talented individuals I have worked with. A very focused individual with a never say never attitude towards any new technological explorations. His zest to constantly learn and innovate is very inspiring! He is supportive and patiently guides anyone from the testing team, constantly encouraging us to ask questions,

He developed the performance testing framework using JMeter-Maven which produced Applihealth Reports was very helpful to measure our legacy and cloud products, The reports were also stored in S3 for future reference. The framework was used by multiple teams on the floor for performance tests, it was much appreciated for it's simplicity and the ability to be easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
