I'm working along with Balu on a couple of projects. He is the kind of person who has lots of patience in sharing his technical knowledge with others and also explains them in a very clear and professional way. He always upgrades himself by being enthusiastic about learning new technologies, understood their purpose, and have in-depth knowledge about it.

I would say that he is truly an expertise in Cloud technologies and the way he delivers his ideas/thoughts in the project is quite impressive. I have gained some good technical knowledge by working with him. He is truly a gem for the employer, colleague, and the project in which he is working.
