- Developed a web solution to ease the process of onboarding potential EMIS Health service partners.
- The solution solves the hectic process of filling loads of forms with a questionnaire about the service contracts and proved to be 4X times more efficient than manual onboarding.
- The tech stack includes SPA Web portals powered by React, Redux, etc., and backend API servers powered by Kotlin (Java), Springboot, and JPA Hibernate.
- Authentication integrated with Okta IAM and APIs has registered to Resource Servers and delegates necessary permissions to users.
- Used Postgres as database and Flyway version SQL scripts.
- Followed Agile process with Sprint planning, retrospectives & daily standups for health checks of the project.
